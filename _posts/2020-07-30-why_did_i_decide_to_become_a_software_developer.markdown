  For most of my life I was never aware of coding, all the way up until High School which was when I was introduced to it, at the time they had only introduced us to the concept of it and even though I didn’t understand I was invested in actually learning.  I am still trying to understand most things and although it has been challenging, I love a challenge.  I never thought I would want to pursue a career in Software Development until a few months back when I saw a video about Flatiron School, it really caught my attention I decided to look the school up and ended up taking the free Bootcamp, I really liked what I saw and the way they teach things here so before I finished the Bootcamp I decided to apply, I haven’t been in the course for long but I know I made a great decision.
   
	Overall choosing to study Software Engineering was not my first career choice but it is the best decision I could have made for myself.
